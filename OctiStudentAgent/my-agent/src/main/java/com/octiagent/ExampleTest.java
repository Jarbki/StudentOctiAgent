 * its opponents over a series of matches.
 * 
 * Modify and use this example as a reference to run your own performance tests.

		 * 1. `PerformanceTest.test(myAgent)`: This part of the code creates a new performance test for the `myAgent` instance. 
		 * 
		 * 2. `.run()`: This method executes the performance test that was set up in the previous step. By not specifying 
		 *    any other configuration methods (like `.random()`, `.color()`, etc.), you are relying on the default values 
		 *    predefined in the PerformanceTest class. 
		 * 
		 * - The agent will play 1 match (default matches value).
		 * - It will have a timeout of 500ms for each move (default timeout value).
		 * - The agent's chosen color will be "red" (default color value).
		 * - The game will be set at difficulty level 0 (default difficulty).
